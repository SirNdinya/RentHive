## 🌟 Introduction

### 📖 Background Information
Finding suitable accommodation is a **crucial aspect of student life**, especially for first-year students and those new to the university environment. While most universities provide on-campus hostels, **limited capacity** forces many students to seek alternative housing options. However, the process of finding off-campus housing is often **challenging** due to factors such as **high rental costs**, **limited availability**, and **lack of reliable information**.

Many students rely on **word-of-mouth recommendations** and **social media groups**, which can expose them to **scams**, **misinformation**, or **overpriced rentals**. Some students end up settling for housing that is either **too expensive**, **inconveniently located**, or **lacking essential amenities**, negatively impacting their university experience.

A **digital platform** dedicated to student accommodation is necessary. This platform will serve as a **bridge between students and landlords**, providing a centralized space for **verified property listings** with essential details such as **images, pricing, amenities, and location**. With an **efficient search and filtering system**, students will be able to find suitable housing based on their preferences, making the accommodation search process **more convenient, secure, and efficient**.

### 🚨 Statement of the Problem
Securing suitable accommodation is a **major challenge** for university students, particularly freshers and those unfamiliar with the surrounding area. With **limited space in on-campus hostels**, many students are forced to look for alternative housing, which can be difficult due to **lack of reliable information, high rental costs, and limited availability**.

The absence of a **structured and trustworthy system** for finding student accommodation leads to **frustration, financial strain, and substandard or inconvenient housing**. Currently, students often rely on **informal sources** such as social media groups, word-of-mouth, or unverified property listings, which may expose them to **fraud or misleading information**. This inefficient process results in **delays, increased housing-related stress, and potential exploitation by dishonest landlords or brokers**.

This project seeks to solve these issues by developing a **digital platform** that connects students with landlords offering rental properties. By providing **verified listings, detailed property descriptions, and advanced search features**, the platform will simplify the accommodation search process, ensuring students can find **affordable, safe, and convenient housing** more efficiently.
